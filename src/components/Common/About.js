            <p>Consequences is an old parlour game in a similar vein to the Surrealist game exquisite corpse and Mad Libs.
            Each player is given a sheet of paper, and all are told to write down a word or phrase to fit a description ("an animal"), optionally with some extra words to make the story. Each player then folds the paper over hide the most recent line, and
            hands it to the next person. At the end of the game, the stories are read out.
